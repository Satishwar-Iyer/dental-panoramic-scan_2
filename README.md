# Dental OPG Images Dataset

The dataset consists of 379 orthopantomogram (OPG) images collected from a dental clinic in India. The images were taken using a digital OPG machine, which captures a panoramic view of the patient's teeth and jaws. The dataset does not contain any personal information about the patients, as it has been deleted for privacy reasons. Additionally, the data does not have any labels or annotations.

## Dataset Details

The OPG images were collected from a dental clinic in India, and the dataset was created for research purposes. Each image in the dataset has a resolution of 2400 x 1200 pixels and is grayscale. The size of each image ranges from 900 KB to 1.1 MB, depending on its complexity.
